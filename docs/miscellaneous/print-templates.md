When you create a new instance of OdinPOS, it comes preloaded with a few
templates.

You use these as they are, or you can _Duplicate_ and customize them.

### Displaying Values

Values can be displayed by mentioning their keys inside curly braces. For example:

```html
<h1>{{ doc.name }}</h1>
```

Here `doc.name` is the key for Invoice No and it will be displayed in an `h1`
element.

The Template Editor can help you by autocompleting the keys as you type the
name.

There are two sets of keys to display values:

1. `doc`: these keys are used to display values from the entry such as Invoice No,
   Account, Date, etc. These keys vary depending on the Entry Type.
2. `print`: these keys are used to read Print Settings values such as Logo,
   Email, Color, etc.

:::tip Key Hints
If you want to see the available values you can click on the **Key Hints**
section below the Template Editor.

### Template Styling

You can either use [inline CSS
styles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/style)
or utility classes from
[tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first) to style the different
components of your templates.

### Applying Changes

To apply the changes made in the editor, you can:

1. Click outside the template editor
2. Press the shortcut keys (`⌃ return` for macOS and `Ctrl Enter` for other
   operating systems).

## Using the Template

After you have edited your template and clicked on the blue Save button to save
the changes you have made. You can use the templates save your entries as PDFs
which you can send to your customers.

To use the template, navigate to the entry and click on the Print button.

![Print Button](./images/print-button.png)

the list on the left.

![Print View](./images/print-view.png)

## Tips for Creating Templates

Here are a few tips to help you create custom print templates.

### Duplicating preloaded templates

If you are not familiar with HTML, CSS and Vue.js Template Syntax then you might
find creating a custom template to be a bit challenging.

If this is the case, we suggest duplicating one of the Preloaded Templates and
editing the duplicate.

![Duplicating the Templates](./images/duplicate-template.png)

This way you can make and apply small changes and see how it affects the Preview
and step by step make the template like how you want it to look.

### Precaution when using tailwindcss

A few of the tailwindcss defaults (for example colors) used in OdinPOS have
been overriden using the
[`tsconfig.js`](https://github.com/frappe/books/blob/master/tailwind.config.js)
file.

Since these values are subject to change we suggest not relying on the overriden
tailwindcss styles. Not doing this may cause your templates to change when we
update the defaults.
