# Number Series

Number Series is used as the naming scheme for
[transactional entries](/transactions/transactional-entries). Multiple
transactions of a single type for example Journal Entry can be grouped under a
single Number Series.

## Default Number Series

By default OdinPOS comes with a single Number Series for each of the
transactional entry types

| Type             | Number Series |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| Sales Invoice    | SINV-         |
| Purchase Invoice | PINV-         |
| Payment          | PAY-          |
| Journal Entry    | JE-           |

These are selected by default when making a transactional entry. You can create
new a Number Series to suit your needs.

::: warning
The Number Series of a transactional entry cannot be changed once Save is
clicked.

Once you are done editing, click on Save, now you can use the new
Number Series for the entry.

## Number Series Fields

The fields decide how the Number Series is set

1. Prefix: The base prefix applied to the number series for example: _SINV-_
2. Reference Type: The transactional entry type to which this Number Series belongs.
3. Start: The number given to the first entry in the Number Series.
4. Pad Zeros: The number of given as padding to the number part of the Number Series.

For example, if Name is _SALES-PAY-_, Start is 0, and Pad Zeros is 3, then the
Number Series values assigned to the transactional entries would be:

_SALES-PAY-000_, _SALES-PAY-001_, _SALES-PAY-002_, _SALES-PAY-003_, etc.
