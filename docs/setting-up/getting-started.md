# Getting Started with Frappe Books

Let’s start applying what we have learned so far by setting up your company in
Frappe Books.

If you have not downloaded Frappe Books, you can download it from here

## Setup Instance

When you open Frappe Books, you’ll be presented two options: **New File** and
**Existing File**. If this is the first time you are opening Frappe Books, click on
**New File**.

a name.

::: tip File Location
Frappe Books stores all your company data and transactions on a local `.db` file on
your computer.

You can change the location of this `.db` file. If you have done so you can find it
again by selecting the **Existing File** option.

Now, enter your Business Name, Business Email and Country Information. This will
help set up the correct Chart of Accounts based on your country.
